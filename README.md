The Collatz Conjecture testing machine

========================
PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
========================

This program is for testing the Collatz conjecture, on any given natural number input.
The Conjecture is that given any natural number, x, if x is even then divide it by 2, and if x is odd, then multiply it by 3 and add 1 and eventually the answer will be 1.
{
  x is odd: 3x + 1,
  x is even: x/2
}
If you repeat this process enough times, you will land up at x = 1 every time.
This has not yet been proven to be true, but there are no known counter examples, so it is believed to be true for all naturals.

This program is to test the conjecture to try and find a counter example.

Enter any natural number into the text box, and the program will follow the process described in the Collatz conjecture until it reaches 1.
